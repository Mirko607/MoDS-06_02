For project cooperation and sharing

Breakout session 4 - topic 06 storing & securing

teams: 
    - 06_01
    - 06_02
   
    
project ideas:

 - git tutorial with specific focus on RDM (06_02: Mirko Johlke, Xu Yang, El Haouni Badr)
   - Text  
   - Video
   - Focus on ?: 
         - what offers git for working together (e.g. each one has it's own branch)
         - In which ways git is limited (size limits for files)
         - availability
         - history/versioning, tracability, how much each author added to the data
         - help by publishing data
 
 - How to write a data policy for a collaborative project? What agreements do you need for a collaborative project 
 
 - What's you backup strategy during your thesis? 
 
 - How to ensure authorship in lab notebooks? digital signatures, time stamps 
 
 - Why and how to use data encryption? 

 - Set up a decision tree in order to help researchers to store and secure data in an appropriate manner (6_01: Judith Stecklina, Andreas Kröpelin, Tobias Jung)
  (maybe analogous to this: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html
•	  - include both securing and storing of data
•	- securing: backups, versioning, encryption, data erasure
•	- storing: which tools for collaborative work (for which research fields), pros/cons, etc.
•	- software, interactive website?
•	- decide between different stages of the data life cycle
•
